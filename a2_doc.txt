The Assignment could have been more clearer as sometimes we didn't know if we had to follow the format exactly, for example for
the titles we didn't know what values from the JSON we should Dynamically insert. Otherwise at the beginning just getting startedwith JQM was a bit troubling, but once you got the hang of it the rest became much easier. It just took a long time to
get to know the library and get started. I found the tutorial and lecture examples to be very relavent and helpful for the assignment. We have added transitions between pages. I have again added dynamic headlines when getting the runs and when 
getting stops. The Dictionary stored in Local Storage is in exactly the same format as shown in your assignment
